Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.

What is NLP?

NLP enables computers to:
- Understand human language as it is spoken and written
- Derive meaning from text
- Generate human-like text
- Translate between languages
- Answer questions
- Summarize long documents

Core NLP Tasks

Text Classification
Assigning categories or labels to text. Applications include:
- Spam detection
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic classification
- Intent recognition

Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifying and classifying named entities in text such as:
- Person names
- Organizations
- Locations
- Dates and times
- Monetary values

Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
Labeling words with their grammatical categories:
- Nouns, verbs, adjectives
- Helps in understanding sentence structure

Text Preprocessing

Tokenization
Breaking text into smaller units (tokens) such as words or sentences.

Example: "I love NLP" → ["I", "love", "NLP"]

Stemming and Lemmatization
Reducing words to their root form:
- Stemming: running → run (crude cutting)
- Lemmatization: better → good (vocabulary-based)

Stop Words Removal
Removing common words that don't carry much meaning (the, is, at, which).

Text Vectorization

Converting text to numerical format that machines can process:

Bag of Words (BoW)
Represents text as a collection of words, ignoring grammar and word order.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
Weighs words by importance in a document relative to a corpus.

Word Embeddings
Dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning:
- Word2Vec: Predicts words from context
- GloVe: Based on word co-occurrence statistics
- FastText: Considers subword information

Contextual Embeddings
Modern embeddings that capture word meaning based on context:
- BERT: Bidirectional understanding
- GPT: Autoregressive generation
- RoBERTa: Optimized BERT
- ELECTRA: Efficient pre-training

NLP Applications

Machine Translation
Translating text from one language to another:
- Google Translate
- DeepL
- Neural Machine Translation systems

Question Answering
Systems that can answer questions posed in natural language:
- Search engines
- Virtual assistants
- FAQ chatbots

Text Summarization
Creating concise summaries of longer documents:
- Extractive: Selecting important sentences
- Abstractive: Generating new sentences

Sentiment Analysis
Determining the emotional tone of text:
- Positive, negative, or neutral
- Customer review analysis
- Social media monitoring
- Brand reputation management

Chatbots and Conversational AI
Systems that can engage in human-like conversations:
- Customer service bots
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Mental health support bots

Advanced NLP Techniques

Attention Mechanism
Allows models to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions. Key innovation in modern NLP.

Transformer Architecture
Revolutionary architecture that uses self-attention:
- Processes sequences in parallel
- Captures long-range dependencies
- Foundation for modern language models

Transfer Learning in NLP
Using pre-trained language models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks:
1. Pre-train on large corpus (billions of words)
2. Fine-tune on specific task with smaller dataset
3. Achieves high performance with less data

Popular Pre-trained Models

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- Understands context from both directions
- Excellent for classification and NER
- Variants: RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT

GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- Autoregressive language model
- Excellent for text generation
- Powers ChatGPT

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- Treats all NLP tasks as text-to-text
- Versatile and powerful

ELECTRA
- Efficient pre-training method
- Smaller and faster than BERT

NLP Evaluation Metrics

BLEU Score
Measures quality of machine-translated text by comparing to reference translations.

ROUGE Score
Evaluates summarization quality by comparing overlap with reference summaries.

Perplexity
Measures how well a language model predicts text. Lower is better.

F1 Score
Harmonic mean of precision and recall, common for classification tasks.

Challenges in NLP

Ambiguity
Words and sentences can have multiple meanings depending on context.

Sarcasm and Irony
Difficult for machines to detect when literal meaning differs from intended meaning.

Context Understanding
Requires understanding broader context, not just individual words.

Multilingual Support
Models need to work across different languages with varying structures.

Bias and Fairness
Language models can perpetuate biases present in training data.
