Machine Learning: Fundamentals and Techniques

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data and makes predictions based on that data. Examples include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data and finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. Examples include clustering algorithms like K-means and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This is commonly used in game playing and robotics.

Popular machine learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Keras. These tools make it easier for developers to build and deploy machine learning models.

The process of building a machine learning model typically involves data collection, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.
